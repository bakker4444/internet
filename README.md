### Assignment details  
For this assignment, we want you to watch how many times you're using <div> tags. Whenever you have one element within a division, it means you don't need that division! For example, imagine you had a code like this  
```
<div id="banner">
  <h1>Word Stream</h1>
</div>
<div id="left_nav">
  <div class="title">
    <h3>WordStream for PPC</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="heading">
     <div class="emphasis">Drive more Profits Through PPC!</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

By looking at the code above, can you identify unnecessary divisions? We hope so! Again, whenever you have one element inside a division, it means that's redundant! Think about how you can refactor the code above to make it simpler. One possible way to refactor the code is to do something like below  
```
<h1 id="banner">Word Stream</h1>
<div id="left_nav">
    <h3>WordStream for PPC</h3>
    <h4>Drive more Profits Through PPC!</h4>
</div>
```

We hope you get the point.  _Putting only one element in another element is like putting your Christmas gift in a box and then putting that box in another box that's slightly bigger (which means that the outer box was not necessary)._  

**Great programmers always do things with less code**, and we want you to practice reviewing your code and always striving to do things in the most simple manner possible. Fewer lines of code -- less text -- this is always better. Please remember that.
